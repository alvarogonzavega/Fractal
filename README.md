# Fractal

You can run the source code on POV-RAY. In this project I had to create a fractal and added to a scene. My idea was to recreate some short of battle in Star Wars. I have 3 fractals here: One Julia hypercomplex, which created the "Death Star", one Sierpinski triangle which is the spaceship attacking the Julia and another Julia which is the fire.
